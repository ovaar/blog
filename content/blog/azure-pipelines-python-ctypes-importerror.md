# Fixing `ctypes` ImportError in Azure Pipelines: Missing `_type_` Attribute

When running `pip install` in an Azure Pipelines self-hosted agent, you might encounter the following error:

```plaintext
File "~\myselfhostedagent\_work\_tool\Python\3.12.3\x64\Lib\site-packages\pip\_vendor\platformdirs\windows.py", line 254, in _pick_get_win_folder
    import ctypes  # noqa: PLC0415
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "ctypes\__init__.py", line 157, in <module>
AttributeError: class must define a '_type_' attribute
```

Interestingly, if you manually execute `pip install` using the same `python.exe`, it works fine. However, when executed within the Azure Pipelines agent, it fails.

In this post, we'll explore why this happens and how to fix it.

## ðŸš¨ **Why Does This Happen?**

### **1. Pythonâ€™s DLL Handling in Windows**

A typical Python installation on Windows consists of:

- `python.exe` in `<PYTHON_ROOT>`.
- Standard libraries in `<PYTHON_ROOT>\Lib`.
- DLLs (such as `_ctypes.pyd`, `_queue.pyd`) in `<PYTHON_ROOT>\DLLs`

Before Python 3.8, Windows would automatically find these DLLs when needed. However, since **Python 3.8**, Microsoft tightened security, and Python now explicitly controls how DLLs are loaded using [`os.add_dll_directory()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.add_dll_directory).

### **2. The Azure Pipelines Environment Is Different**

- When you run `python.exe` manually, your user session **automatically resolves** the `DLLs` directory.
- When the Azure Pipelines agent runs Python, it **starts in a minimal environment**, and Windows **does not find the required DLLs** unless they are explicitly referenced.

### **3. Why pip Fails**

The `ctypes` module relies on system DLLs to function. Since the Python DLLs directory is not in `PATH`, Windows fails to load necessary components, resulting in:

```plaintext
AttributeError: class must define a '_type_' attribute
```

---

## âœ… **How to Fix It**

To ensure the agent can find the DLLs, **prepend the `DLLs` directory** to the PATH in the pipeline:

```yaml
steps:
  - script: |
      PYTHON_ROOT=$(python -c "import sys; import os; print(os.path.dirname(sys.executable))")
      echo "##vso[task.prependpath]${PYTHON_ROOT}/DLLs"
    displayName: "Fix Python DLL Path"
```

This tells Windows to search Pythonâ€™s `DLLs` directory when loading system dependencies.

---

## ðŸ”§ **Minimal Azure Pipelines YAML File**

Hereâ€™s a minimal example including `UsePythonVersion@0` to ensure the correct Python version is used:

```yaml
trigger: main

pool:
  name: Self-Hosted-Agent-Pool

steps:
  - task: UsePythonVersion@0
    inputs:
      versionSpec: '3.12'
      addToPath: true

  - script: |
      PYTHON_ROOT=$(python -c "import sys; import os; print(os.path.dirname(sys.executable))")
      echo "##vso[task.prependpath]${PYTHON_ROOT}/DLLs"
    displayName: "Fix Python DLL Path"

  - script: |
      python -m pip install --upgrade pip
      python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    displayName: "Install Dependencies"
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ **Alternative: Use **``

If you prefer not to modify `PATH`, you can explicitly set the DLL directory inside your Python script before using `ctypes`:

```python
import os
import sys

dll_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(sys.executable), "DLLs")
os.add_dll_directory(dll_path)

import ctypes  # This should now work correctly
```

However, setting `PATH` in the pipeline is a more universal fix, ensuring all Python processes in the build agent work without modification.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Conclusion**

- **Why does this happen?** Windows no longer automatically searches Pythonâ€™s `DLLs` folder.
- **Why only in Azure Pipelines?** The agent runs with a minimal environment that lacks the required paths.
- **How to fix it?** Prepend the `DLLs` directory to `PATH` in the pipeline or use `os.add_dll_directory()` in Python scripts.

By applying this fix, you can prevent `pip install` and `ctypes`-related failures in your Azure Pipelines self-hosted agent.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
